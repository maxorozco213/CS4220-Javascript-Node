### Week 2 - Arrays and objects
- Remove all occurences of a specific letter in a give string
- Implement `Array.flat()` manually
- Modify objects by removing elements and creating new ones
- Create an object to store a letter and the number of occurences
- Compare arrays to each other without using built in functions
- Convert arrays into objects

### Week 3 - Higher order functions
- Practice using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`
- Higher order fucntions to iterate objects

### Week 5 - Async/await and Callbacks
- Use callbacks to print higher response times later than the lower response times
- Use promises to sort object elements into new objects
- User async/await to achieve the same thing as the promise function
